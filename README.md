# CS 439 Low Level Graphic
-Overview: My goal for this project was to create a low-level graphic in a programming language we have gone through so far in class. I knew I wanted to use python and pygame to create the image, but I wanted to do so without your simpleGE game engine, and just use raw pygame. My low-level graphic is a (very simple) Indiana Pacers logo. I took a while to decide what to do. I originally wanted to do something simpler like a smiley face, but I decided that was too boring, and I love sports, so I figured the Pacers logo would be a fun, simple challenge.

-Technologies Used: Like I said before, I used pygame to create the surface that I would be drawing onto. Then, I used the pygame.draw function to draw different rectangles, circles, and lines to try to replicate the Pacers logo. To find the colors I wanted, I used google's color picker tool until I got the RBG values I needed.

-What I learned while writing this demo was that using raw pygame is definitely weird at first, but not impossible. I think I want to try to write my final project in pygame without using simpleGE to help. I also learned what all the parameters for drawing different shapes are.

-No abnormal run instructions. Obviously make sure you have pygame installed, then just download and run the .py file in whatever IDE you prefer to use.

-There were no external resources brought in for this project, but I based my graphic off of the Indiana Pacers logo.
